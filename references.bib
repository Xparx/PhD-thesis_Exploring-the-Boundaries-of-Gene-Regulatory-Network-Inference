                   science. To uncover their structural design
                   principles, we defined “network motifs,” patterns
                   of interconnections occurring in complex networks at
                   numbers that are significantly higher than those in
                   randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks
                   from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and
                   engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food
                   webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the
                   genetic networks of Escherichia coli and
                   Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the
                   World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks
                   that perform information processing, even though they
                   describe elements as different as biomolecules within
                   a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in
                   Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define
                   universal classes of networks. This approach may
                   uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

  abstract =      {The ability to characterize biological dynamics is
                   important for understanding the integrated molecular
                   processes that underlie normal and abnormal cellular
                   states. The availability of metabolomic data, in
                   addition to new developments in the formal
                   description of dynamic states of networks, has
                   enabled a new data integration approach for building
                   large-scale kinetic networks. We show that dynamic
                   network models can be constructed in a scalable
                   manner using metabolomic data mapped onto
                   stoichiometric models, resulting in mass action
                   stoichiometric simulation (MASS) models. Enzymes and
                   their various functional states are represented
                   explicitly as compounds, or nodes in a stoichiometric
                   network, within this formalism. Analyses and
                   simulations of \{MASS\} models explicitly show that
                   regulatory enzymes can control dynamic states of
                   networks in part by binding numerous metabolites at
                   multiple sites. Thus, network functional states are
                   reflected in the fractional states of a regulatory
                   enzyme, such as the fraction of the total enzyme
                   concentration that is in a catalytically active
                   versus inactive state. The feasible construction of
                   \{MASS\} models represents a practical means to
                   increase the size, scope, and predictive capabilities
                   of dynamic network models in cell and molecular

                   high-resolution two-dimensional (2D) gel

                   and identified by capillary liquid
                   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
                   Protein spots were quantified by metabolic labeling
                   and scintillation counting. Corresponding mRNA levels
                   were calculated from serial analysis of gene
                   expression (SAGE) frequency tables (V. E. Velculescu,
                   L. Zhang, W. Zhou, J. Vogelstein, M. A. Basrai, D. E.

                   Kinzler, Cell 88:243–251, 1997). We found that the
                   correlation between mRNA and protein levels was
                   insufficient to predict protein expression levels
                   from quantitative mRNA data. Indeed, for some genes,
                   while the mRNA levels were of the same value the
                   protein levels varied by more than 20-fold.
                   Conversely, invariant steady-state levels of certain
                   proteins were observed with respective mRNA
                   transcript levels that varied by as much as 30-fold.
                   Another interesting observation is that codon bias is
                   not a predictor of either protein or mRNA levels. Our
                   results clearly delineate the technical boundaries of
                   current approaches for quantitative analysis of
                   protein expression and reveal that simple deduction
                   from mRNA transcript analysis is insufficient.},

                   (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/) during the past 2
                   years. We have kept up-to-date the knowledge from the
                   published literature regarding transcriptional
                   regulation in Escherichia coli K-12. We have
                   maintained and expanded our curation efforts to
                   improve the breadth and quality of the encoded
                   experimental knowledge, and we have implemented
                   criteria for the quality of our computational
                   predictions. Regulatory phrases now provide
                   high-level descriptions of regulatory regions. We
                   expanded the assignment of quality to various sources
                   of evidence, particularly for knowledge generated
                   through high-throughput (HT) technology. Based on our
                   analysis of most relevant methods, we defined rules
                   for determining the quality of evidence when multiple
                   independent sources support an entry. With this
                   latest release of RegulonDB, we present a new highly
                   reliable larger collection of transcription start
                   sites, a result of our experimental HT genome-wide
                   efforts. These improvements, together with several
                   novel enhancements (the tracks display, uploading
                   format and curational guidelines), address the
                   challenges of incorporating HT-generated knowledge
                   into RegulonDB. Information on the evolutionary
                   conservation of regulatory elements is also available
                   now. Altogether, RegulonDB version 8.0 is a much
                   better home for integrating knowledge on gene

                   this database contains over 200 000 regulatory
                   associations between transcription factors (TFs) and
                   target genes, including 326 DNA binding sites for 113

                   take place and on whether the TF is acting on its
                   target genes as activator or repressor. Based on this

                   predictive, preventive, personalized and
                   participatory was regarded as highly speculative.
                   Today, the core elements of that vision are widely
                   accepted and have been articulated in a series of
                   recent reports by the US Institute of Medicine.
                   Systems approaches to biology and medicine are now
                   beginning to provide patients, consumers and
                   physicians with personalized information about each

                   health and disease at the molecular, cellular and
                   organ levels. This information will make disease care
                   radically more cost effective by personalizing care
                   to each person{\^a}??s unique biology and by treating
                   the causes rather than the symptoms of disease. It

                   consumers to improve their health as they observe the

                   digitally powered familial and affinity networks,

  abstract =      {Analysis of gene expression data sets reveals that
                   the variation in expression is concentrated to
                   significantly fewer 'characteristic modes' or
                   'eigengenes' than the number of both recorded assays
                   and measured genes. Previous works have stressed the
                   importance of these characteristic modes, but
                   neglected the equally important weak modes. Herein a
                   generic system property - interampatteness - is
                   defined that explains the previous feature, and
                   assigns equal weight to the characteristic and weak
                   modes. An interampatte network is characterised by
                   strong INTERactions enabling simultaneous
                   AMPlification and ATTEnuation of different signals.
                   It is postulated that biochemical networks are
                   interampatte, based on published experimental data
                   and theoretical considerations. Existence of multiple
                   time-scales and feedback loops is shown to increase
                   the degree of interampatteness. Interampatteness has
                   strong implications for the dynamics and reverse
                   engineering of the network. One consequence is highly
                   correlated changes in gene expression in response to
                   external perturbations, even in the absence of common
                   transcription factors, implying that interampatte
                   gene regulatory networks erroneously may be assumed
                   to have co-expressed/co-regulated genes. Data
                   compression or reduction of the system dimensionality
                   using clustering, singular value decomposition,
                   principal component analysis or some other data
                   mining technique results in a loss of information

  abstract =      {Systems theory and cell biology have enjoyed a long
                   relationship that has received renewed interest in
                   recent years in the context of systems biology. The
                   term 'systems' in systems biology comes from systems
                   theory or dynamic systems theory: systems biology is
                   defined through the application of systems- and
                   signal-oriented approaches for an understanding of
                   inter- and intra-cellular dynamic processes. The aim
                   of the present text is to review the systems and
                   control perspective of dynamic systems. The
                   biologist's conceptual framework for representing the
                   variables of a biochemical reaction network, and for
                   describing their relationships, are pathway maps. A
                   principal goal of systems biology is to turn these
                   static maps into dynamic models, which can provide
                   insight into the temporal evolution of biochemical
                   reaction networks. Towards this end, we review the
                   case for differential equation models as a 'natural'
                   representation of causal entailment in pathways.
                   Block-diagrams, commonly used in the engineering
                   sciences, are introduced and compared to pathway
                   maps. The stimulus-response representation of a
                   molecular system is a necessary condition for an
                   understanding of dynamic interactions among the
                   components that make up a pathway. Using simple
                   examples, we show how biochemical reactions are
                   modelled in the dynamic systems framework and
                   visualized using block-diagrams.},

                   strategy for ensuring that the output of a system
                   robustly tracks its desired value independent of
                   noise or variations in system parameters. In
                   biological systems, it is common for the response to
                   an extracellular stimulus to return to its
                   prestimulus value even in the continued presence of
                   the signal--a process termed adaptation or
                   desensitization. Barkai, Alon, Surette, and Leibler
                   have provided both theoretical and experimental
                   evidence that the precision of adaptation in
                   bacterial chemotaxis is robust to dramatic changes in
                   the levels and kinetic rate constants of the
                   constituent proteins in this signaling network [Alon,
                   U., Surette, M. G., Barkai, N. & Leibler, S. (1998)
                   Nature (London) 397, 168--171]. Here we propose that
                   the robustness of perfect adaptation is the result of
                   this system possessing the property of integral
                   feedback control. Using techniques from control and
                   dynamical systems theory, we demonstrate that
                   integral control is structurally inherent in the
                   Barkai–Leibler model and identify and characterize
                   the key assumptions of the model. Most importantly,
                   we argue that integral control in some form is
                   necessary for a robust implementation of perfect
                   adaptation. More generally, integral control may
                   underlie the robustness of many homeostatic
                   mechanisms.},

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND:Determining the interaction topology of
                   biological systems is a topic that currently attracts
                   significant research interest. Typical models for
                   such systems take the form of differential equations
                   that involve polynomial and rational functions. Such
                   nonlinear models make the problem of determining the
                   connectivity of biochemical networks from time-series
                   experimental data much harder. The use of linear
                   dynamics and linearization techniques that have been
                   proposed in the past can circumvent this, but the
                   general problem of developing efficient algorithms
                   for models that provide more accurate system
                   descriptions remains open.RESULTS:We present a
                   network determination algorithm that can treat model
                   descriptions with polynomial and rational functions
                   and which does not make use of linearization. For
                   this purpose, we make use of the observation that
                   biochemical networks are in general 'sparse' and
                   minimize the 1-norm of the decision variables (sum of
                   weighted network connections) while constraints keep
                   the error between data and the network dynamics
                   small. The emphasis of our methodology is on
                   determining the interconnection topology rather than
                   the specific reaction constants and it takes into
                   account the necessary properties that a chemical
                   reaction network should have - something that
                   techniques based on linearization can not. The
                   problem can be formulated as a Linear Program, a
                   convex optimization problem, for which efficient
                   algorithms are available that can treat large data
                   sets efficiently and uncertainties in data or model
                   parameters.CONCLUSION:The presented methodology is
                   able to predict with accuracy and efficiency the
                   connectivity structure of a chemical reaction network
                   with mass action kinetics and of a gene regulatory
                   network from simulation data even if the dynamics of
                   these systems are non-polynomial (rational) and
                   uncertainties in the data are taken into account. It
                   also produces a network structure that can explain
                   the real experimental data of L. lactis and is
                   similar to the one found in the literature. Numerical
                   methods based on Linear Programming can therefore
                   help determine efficiently the network structure of
                   biological systems from large data sets. The overall
                   objective of this work is to provide methods to
                   increase our understanding of complex biochemical
                   systems, particularly through their interconnection
                   and their non-equilibrium behavior.},

                   used to infer and analyze the structure and function
                   of an aging and glucose repressed gene regulatory
                   network in the budding yeast Saccharomyces
                   cerevisiae. The method uses transcriptional
                   perturbations to model the functional interactions
                   between genes as a system of first-order ordinary
                   differential equations. The resulting network model
                   correctly identified the known interactions of key
                   regulators in a 10-gene network from the Snf1
                   signaling pathway, which is required for expression
                   of glucose-repressed genes upon calorie restriction.
                   The majority of interactions predicted by the network
                   model were confirmed using promoter-reporter gene
                   fusions in gene-deletion mutants and chromatin
                   immunoprecipitation experiments, revealing a more
                   complex network architecture than previously
                   appreciated. The reverse-engineered network model
                   also predicted an unexpected role for transcriptional
                   regulation of the SNF1 gene by hexose kinase
                   enzyme/transcriptional repressor Hxk2, Mediator

                   These interactions were validated experimentally and
                   used to design new experiments demonstrating Snf1 and
                   its transcriptional regulators Hxk2 and Mig1 as
                   modulators of chronological lifespan. This work
                   demonstrates the value of using network inference

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: Elucidating gene regulatory networks is
                   crucial for understanding normal cell physiology and
                   complex pathologic phenotypes. Existing computational
                   methods for the genome-wide "reverse engineering" of
                   such networks have been successful only for lower
                   eukaryotes with simple genomes. Here we present
                   ARACNE, a novel algorithm, using microarray
                   expression profiles, specifically designed to scale
                   up to the complexity of regulatory networks in
                   mammalian cells, yet general enough to address a
                   wider range of network deconvolution problems. This
                   method uses an information theoretic approach to
                   eliminate the majority of indirect interactions
                   inferred by co-expression methods. RESULTS: We prove
                   that ARACNE reconstructs the network exactly
                   (asymptotically) if the effect of loops in the
                   network topology is negligible, and we show that the
                   algorithm works well in practice, even in the
                   presence of numerous loops and complex topologies. We
                   assess ARACNE's ability to reconstruct
                   transcriptional regulatory networks using both a
                   realistic synthetic dataset and a microarray dataset
                   from human B cells. On synthetic datasets ARACNE
                   achieves very low error rates and outperforms
                   established methods, such as Relevance Networks and
                   Bayesian Networks. Application to the deconvolution
                   of genetic networks in human B cells demonstrates
                   ARACNE's ability to infer validated transcriptional
                   targets of the cMYC proto-oncogene. We also study the
                   effects of misestimation of mutual information on
                   network reconstruction, and show that algorithms
                   based on mutual information ranking are more
                   resilient to estimation errors. CONCLUSION: ARACNE
                   shows promise in identifying direct transcriptional
                   interactions in mammalian cellular networks, a
                   problem that has challenged existing reverse
                   engineering algorithms. This approach should enhance
                   our ability to use microarray data to elucidate
                   functional mechanisms that underlie cellular
                   processes and to identify molecular targets of
                   pharmacological compounds in mammalian cellular
                   networks.},

                   is initiated by a pre-pattern of pair-rule gene
                   products and maintained by a network of regulatory
                   interactions throughout several stages of embryonic
                   development. Analysis of a model of gene interactions
                   based on differential equations showed that wild-type
                   expression patterns of these genes can be obtained
                   for a wide range of kinetic parameters, which
                   suggests that the steady states are determined by the
                   topology of the network and the type of regulatory
                   interactions between components, not the detailed
                   form of the rate laws. To investigate this, we
                   propose and analyse a Boolean model of this network
                   which is based on a binary ON/OFF representation of
                   mRNA and protein levels, and in which the
                   interactions are formulated as logical functions. In
                   this model the spatial and temporal patterns of gene
                   expression are determined by the topology of the
                   network and whether components are present or absent,
                   rather than the absolute levels of the mRNAs and
                   proteins and the functional details of their
                   interactions. The model is able to reproduce the
                   wild-type gene expression patterns, as well as the
                   ectopic expression patterns observed in
                   overexpression experiments and various mutants.
                   Furthermore, we compute explicitly all steady states
                   of the network and identify the basin of attraction
                   of each steady state. The model gives important
                   insights into the functioning of the segment polarity
                   gene network, such as the crucial role of the
                   wingless and sloppy paired genes, and the network's
                   ability to correct errors in the pre-pattern.},

                   a consequence, formal methods and computer tools for
                   the modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory
                   networks will be indispensable. This paper reviews
                   formalisms that have been employed in mathematical
                   biology and bioinformatics to describe genetic
                   regulatory systems, in particular directed graphs,
                   Bayesian networks, Boolean networks and their
                   generalizations, ordinary and partial differential
                   equations, qualitative differential equations,
                   stochastic equations, and rule-based formalisms. In
                   addition, the paper discusses how these formalisms
                   have been used in the simulation of the behavior of
                   actual regulatory systems.},

                   of biological systems by integrating experimental and
                   theoretical techniques. During the last decade, many
                   systems biological approaches that base on
                   genome-wide data have been developed to unravel the
                   complexity of gene regulation. This review deals with
                   the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs)
                   from experimental data through computational methods.
                   Standard GRN inference methods primarily use gene
                   expression data derived from microarrays. However,
                   the incorporation of additional information from
                   heterogeneous data sources, e.g. genome sequence and
                   protein-DNA interaction data, clearly supports the
                   network inference process. This review focuses on
                   promising modelling approaches that use such diverse
                   types of molecular biological information. In
                   particular, approaches are discussed that enable the
                   modelling of the dynamics of gene regulatory systems.
                   The review provides an overview of common modelling
                   schemes and learning algorithms and outlines current

  abstract =      {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for
                   model assessment, model comparison, convergence
                   diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In
                   this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in
                   using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent
                   problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can
                   only be estimated for linear models. Concerning
                   nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is
                   unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the
                   value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise
                   in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared
                   itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is
                   uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of
                   reduced chi-squared for differentiating between
                   models or assessing convergence of a minimisation
                   procedure. The impact of noise on the value of
                   reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in
                   particular for small data sets, which are very common
                   in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced
                   chi-squared can only be used with due caution for
                   linear models, whereas it must not be used for
                   nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more
                   sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also
                   applicable to nonlinear models.},

                   task of deducing the connectivity of large-scale gene

                   models for the fundamental biological process of
                   transcription and translation. The expression levels
                   of the genes are typically measured as mRNA
                   concentration in micro-array experiments. In a
                   so-called genetic perturbation experiment, small
                   perturbations are applied to equilibrium states and
                   the resulting changes in expression activity are
                   measured. One of the most important problems in
                   systems biology is to use these data to identify the
                   interaction pattern between genes in a regulatory
                   network, especially in a large scale network. The
                   authors develop a novel algorithm for identifying the
                   smallest genetic network that explains genetic
                   perturbation experimental data. By construction, our

                   respect a priori knowledge known about the network
                   structure. A priori biological knowledge is typically
                   qualitative, encoding whether one gene affects
                   another gene or not, or whether the effect is
                   positive or negative. The method is based on a convex
                   programming relaxation of the combinatorially hard
                   problem of L(0) minimisation. The authors apply the

                   models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of
                   squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of
                   the coefficients being less than a constant. Because
                   of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce
                   some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives
                   interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest
                   that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable
                   properties of both subset selection and ridge
                   regression. It produces interpretable models like
                   subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge
                   regression. There is also an interesting relationship
                   with recent work in adaptive function estimation by
                   Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general
                   and can be applied in a variety of statistical

  abstract =      {Sparsity or parsimony of statistical models is
                   crucial for their proper interpretations, as in
                   sciences and social sciences. Model selection is a
                   commonly used method to find such models, but usually
                   involves a computationally heavy combinatorial
                   search. Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) is now being used as
                   a computationally feasible alternative to model
                   selection. Therefore it is important to study Lasso
                   for model selection purposes. In this paper, we prove
                   that a single condition, which we call the
                   Irrepresentable Condition, is almost necessary and
                   sufficient for Lasso to select the true model both in
                   the classical fixed p setting and in the large p
                   setting as the sample size n gets large. Based on
                   these results, sufficient conditions that are
                   verifiable in practice are given to relate to
                   previous works and help applications of Lasso for
                   feature selection and sparse representation. This
                   Irrepresentable Condition, which depends mainly on
                   the covariance of the predictor variables, states
                   that Lasso selects the true model consistently if and
                   (almost) only if the predictors that are not in the
                   true model are "irrepresentable" (in a sense to be
                   clarified) by predictors that are in the true model.
                   Furthermore, simulations are carried out to provide
                   insights and understanding of this result.},

                   variables than observations, and z is a stochastic
                   error term--the so-called "p>n" setup. When $\beta$
                   is sparse, or, more generally, when there is a sparse
                   subset of covariates providing a close approximation
                   to the unknown mean vector, we ask whether or not it
                   is possible to accurately estimate X$\beta$ using a

                   should and should not be included in the model.
                   Interestingly, our results describe the average
                   performance of the lasso; that is, the performance
                   one can expect in an vast majority of cases where
                   X$\beta$ is a sparse or nearly sparse superposition
                   of variables, but not in all cases. Our results are
                   nonasymptotic and widely applicable, since they
                   simply require that pairs of predictor variables are
                   not too collinear.},

  abstract =      {Preconditioning is a technique from numerical linear
                   algebra that can accelerate algorithms to solve
                   systems of equations. In this pa- per, we demonstrate
                   how preconditioning can circumvent a stringent
                   assumption for sign consistency in sparse linear
                   regression. Given $X \in R^{n\times p}$ and $Y \in
                   R^n$ that satisfy the standard regression equation,
                   this paper demonstrates that even if the design
                   matrix X does not satisfy the irrepresentable
                   condition for the Lasso, the design matrix F X often
                   does, where $F \in R^{n\times n}$ is a
                   preconditioning matrix defined in this paper. By
                   computing the Lasso on (F X, F Y), instead of on (X,
                   Y), the necessary assumptions on X become much less
                   stringent. Our preconditioner F ensures that the
                   singular values of the design matrix are either zero
                   or one. When $n \geq p$, the columns of F X are
                   orthogonal and the preconditioner always circumvents
                   the stringent assumptions. When $p \geq n$, $F$
                   projects the design matrix onto the Stiefel manifold;
                   the rows of F X are orthogonal. We give both
                   theoretical results and simulation results to show
                   that, in the high dimensional case, the
                   preconditioner helps to circumvent the stringent
                   assumptions, improving the statistical performance of
                   a broad class of model selection techniques in linear
                   regression. Simulation results are particularly
                   promising.},

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND:The inference of complex networks from
                   data is a challenging problem in biological sciences,
                   as well as in a wide range of disciplines such as
                   chemistry, technology, economics, or sociology. The
                   quantity and quality of the data greatly affect the
                   results. While many methodologies have been developed
                   for this task, they seldom take into account issues
                   such as missing data or outlier detection and
                   correction, which need to be properly addressed
                   before network inference.RESULTS:Here we present an
                   approach to (i) handle missing data and (ii) detect
                   and correct outliers based on multivariate projection
                   to latent structures. The method, called trimmed
                   scores regression (TSR), enables network inference
                   methods to analyse incomplete datasets by imputing
                   the missing values coherently with the latent data
                   structure. Furthermore, it substitutes the faulty
                   values in a dataset by proper estimations. We provide
                   an implementation of this approach, and show how it
                   can be integrated with any network inference method
                   as a preliminary data curation step. This
                   functionality is demonstrated with a state of the art
                   network inference method based on mutual information
                   distance and entropy reduction, MIDER.CONCLUSION:The
                   methodology presented here enables network inference
                   methods to analyse a large number of incomplete and
                   faulty datasets that could not be reliably analysed
                   so far. Our comparative studies show the superiority
                   of TSR over other missing data approaches used by
                   practitioners. Furthermore, the method allows for
                   outlier detection and correction.},

                   context of the DREAM (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering

                   which have been applied independently by

                   been an intensively studied topic in bioinformatics
                   since it constitutes an intermediate step from
                   explorative to causative gene expression analysis.
                   Many methods have been proposed through recent years
                   leading to a wide range of mathematical approaches.
                   In practice, different mathematical approaches will
                   generate different resulting network structures,
                   thus, it is very important for users to assess the
                   performance of these algorithms. We have conducted a
                   comparative study with six different reverse
                   engineering methods, including relevance networks,
                   neural networks, and Bayesian networks. Our approach

                   "benchmarking" of reverse-engineering and modeling
                   approaches. The network is composed of five genes

                   interactions; it is negligibly affected by endogenous

                   (GRNs) is a central goal of bioinformatics highly
                   accelerated by the advent of new experimental
                   techniques, such as RNA interference. A battery of
                   reverse engineering methods has been developed in
                   recent years to reconstruct the underlying GRNs from
                   these and other experimental data. However, the
                   performance of the individual methods is poorly
                   understood and validation of algorithmic performances
                   is still missing to a large extent. To enable such
                   systematic validation, we have developed the web
                   application GeNGe (GEne Network GEnerator), a
                   controlled framework for the automatic generation of
                   GRNs. The theoretical model for a GRN is a non-linear
                   differential equation system. Networks can be
                   user-defined or constructed in a modular way with the
                   option to introduce global and local network
                   perturbations. Resulting data can be used, e.g. as
                   benchmark data for evaluating GRN reconstruction
                   methods or for predicting effects of perturbations as
                   theoretical counterparts of biological experiments.

  abstract =      {MOTIVATION: Over the last decade, numerous methods
                   have been developed for inference of regulatory
                   networks from gene expression data. However, accurate
                   and systematic evaluation of these methods is
                   hampered by the difficulty of constructing adequate
                   benchmarks and the lack of tools for a differentiated
                   analysis of network predictions on such benchmarks.
                   RESULTS: Here we describe a novel and comprehensive
                   method for in silico benchmark generation and
                   performance profiling of network inference methods
                   available to the community as an open-source software
                   called GeneNetWeaver (GNW). In addition to the
                   generation of detailed dynamical models of gene
                   regulatory networks to be used as benchmarks, GNW
                   provides a network motif analysis that reveals
                   systematic prediction errors, thereby indicating
                   potential ways of improving inference methods. The
                   accuracy of network inference methods is evaluated
                   using standard metrics such as precision-recall and
                   receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. We
                   show how GNW can be used to assess the performance
                   and identify the strengths and weaknesses of six
                   inference methods. Furthermore, we used GNW to
                   provide the international DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse

  abstract =      {In this thesis, inference of biological networks from
                   in vivo data generated by perturbation experiments is
                   considered, i.e. deduction of causal interactions
                   that exist among the observed variables. Knowledge of
                   such regulatory influences is essential in biology. A
                   system property--interampatteness--is introduced that
                   explains why the variation in existing gene
                   expression data is concentrated to a few
                   "characteristic modes" or "eigengenes", and why
                   previously inferred models have a large number of
                   false positive and false negative links. An
                   interampatte system is characterized by strong
                   INTERactions enabling simultaneous AMPlification and
                   ATTEnuation of different signals and we show that
                   perturbation of individual state variables, e.g.
                   genes, typically leads to ill-conditioned data with
                   both characteristic and weak modes. The weak modes
                   are typically dominated by measurement noise due to
                   poor excitation and their existence hampers network
                   reconstruction. The excitation problem is solved by
                   iterative design of correlated multi-gene
                   perturbation experiments that counteract the
                   intrinsic signal attenuation of the system. The next
                   perturbation should be designed such that the
                   expected response practically spans an additional
                   dimension of the state space. The proposed design is
                   numerically demonstrated for the Snf1 signalling
                   pathway in S. cerevisiae. The impact of unperturbed
                   and unobserved latent state variables, that exist in
                   any real biological system, on the inferred network
                   and required set-up of the experiments for network
                   inference is analysed. Their existence implies that a
                   subnetwork of pseudo-direct causal regulatory
                   influences, accounting for all environmental effects,
                   in general is inferred. In principle, the number of
                   latent states and different paths between the nodes
                   of the network can be estimated, but their identity
                   cannot be determined unless they are observed or
                   perturbed directly. Network inference is recognized
                   as a variable/model selection problem and solved by
                   considering all possible models of a specified class
                   that can explain the data at a desired significance
                   level, and by classifying only the links present in
                   all of these models as existing. As shown, these
                   links can be determined without any parameter
                   estimation by reformulating the variable selection
                   problem as a robust rank problem. Solution of the
                   rank problem enable assignment of confidence to
                   individual interactions, without resorting to any

                   gene networks based on an ensemble of multilayer
                   perceptrons. The algorithm builds a regressor for
                   each gene in the network, estimating its
                   \emph{neighborhood} independently. The overall
                   network is obtained by joining all the neighborhoods.
                   RegnANN makes no assumptions about the nature of the
                   relationships between the variables, potentially
                   capturing high-order and non linear dependencies
                   between expression patterns. The evaluation focuses
                   on synthetic data mimicking plausible submodules of
                   larger networks and on biological data consisting of
                   submodules of \emph{Escherichia coli}. We consider
                   Barabasi and Erdös-Rényi topologies together with
                   two methods for data generation. We verify the effect

                   reconstruct gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from
                   experimental data and other a priori information. The
                   DREAM project offers some types of experimental data,
                   such as knockout data, knockdown data, time series
                   data, etc. Among them, multifactorial perturbation
                   data are easier and less expensive to obtain than
                   other types of experimental data and are thus more
                   common in practice. In this article, a new algorithm
                   is presented for the inference of GRNs using the
                   DREAM4 multifactorial perturbation data. The GRN
                   inference problem among [Formula: see text] genes is
                   decomposed into [Formula: see text] different
                   regression problems. In each of the regression
                   problems, the expression level of a target gene is
                   predicted solely from the expression level of a
                   potential regulation gene. For different potential
                   regulation genes, different weights for a specific
                   target gene are constructed by using the sum of
                   squared residuals and the Pearson correlation
                   coefficient. Then these weights are normalized to
                   reflect effort differences of regulating distinct
                   genes. By appropriately choosing the parameters of
                   the power law, we constructe a 0-1 integer
                   programming problem. By solving this problem, direct
                   regulation genes for an arbitrary gene can be
                   estimated. And, the normalized weight of a gene is
                   modified, on the basis of the estimation results
                   about the existence of direct regulations to it.
                   These normalized and modified weights are used in
                   queuing the possibility of the existence of a
                   corresponding direct regulation. Computation results
                   with the DREAM4 In Silico Size 100 Multifactorial
                   subchallenge show that estimation performances of the
                   suggested algorithm can even outperform the best
                   team. Using the real data provided by the DREAM5
                   Network Inference Challenge, estimation performances
                   can be ranked third. Furthermore, the high precision
                   of the obtained most reliable predictions shows the
                   suggested algorithm may be helpful in guiding
                   biological experiment designs.},

                   develop a modeling framework, EPoC (Endogenous
                   Perturbation analysis of Cancer), to (1) detect
                   disease-driving CNAs and their effect on target mRNA
                   expression, and to (2) stratify cancer patients into
                   long- and short-term survivors. Our method constructs
                   causal network models of gene expression by combining
                   genome-wide DNA- and RNA-level data. Prognostic
                   scores are obtained from a singular value
                   decomposition of the networks. By applying EPoC to
                   glioblastoma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas

                   models contain known disease-relevant hub genes,
                   reveal interesting candidate hubs, and uncover
                   predictors of patient survival. Targeted validations

                   We introduce non-concave penalties and the adaptive
                   LASSO penalty to attenuate the bias problem in the
                   network estimation. Through the local linear
                   approximation to the non-concave penalty functions,
                   the problem of precision matrix estimation is recast
                   as a sequence of penalized likelihood problems with a
                   weighted L(1) penalty and solved using the efficient
                   algorithm of Friedman et al. (2008). Our estimation
                   schemes are applied to two real datasets. Simulation
                   experiments and asymptotic theory are used to justify
                   our proposed methods.},

  abstract =      {A common problem in inference of gene regulatory
                   networks from experimental response data is the
                   relatively small number of samples available in
                   relation to the number of nodes/states. In many cases
                   the identification problem is underdetermined and
                   prior knowledge is required for the network
                   reconstruction. A specific prior that has gained
                   widespread popularity is the assumption that the
                   underlying network is sparsely connected. This has
                   led to a flood of network reconstruction algorithms
                   based on subset selection and regularization
                   techniques, mainly adopted from the statistics and
                   signal processing communities. In particular, methods
                   based on $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$-penalties on the
                   interaction strengths, such as LASSO, have been
                   widely proposed and applied. We briefly review some
                   of these methods and discuss their suitability for
                   inferring the structure of biochemical networks. A
                   particular problem is the fact that these methods
                   provide little or no information on the uncertainty
                   of individual identified edges, combined with the
                   fact that the identified networks usually have a
                   large fraction of false positives as well as false
                   negatives.To partly overcome these problems we
                   consider conditions that can be used to classify
                   edges into those that can be uniquely determined
                   based on a given incomplete data set, those that
                   cannot be uniquely determined due to collinearity in
                   the data and those for which no information is
                   available. Apart from providing a label of confidence
                   for the individual edges in the identified network,
                   the classification can be used to improve the
                   reconstruction by employing standard unbiased
                   identification methods to the identifiable edges
                   while employing sparse approximation methods for the
                   remaining network. The method is demonstrated through
                   application to a synthetic network in yeast which has
                   recently been proposed for in vivo assessment of
                   network identification methods.},

  year =          {2012},
  abstract =      {Motivation: Genome-wide fitness is an emerging type
                   of high-throughput biological data generated for an
                   individual organism by creating a library of
                   single-knockouts, subjecting it to a broad range of
                   environmental conditions, and measuring the resulting
                   clone-specific fitnesses. Since fitness is an
                   organism-scale measure of gene regulatory network
                   behavior, it may offer certain advantages when
                   insights into such phenotypical as well as functional
                   features are of primary interest over individual gene
                   expression. Previous works, e.g., Deutschbauer et al.
                   (2011), have shown that genome-wide fitness data can
                   be used to uncover novel gene regulatory
                   interactions, when compared with the results of the
                   more conventional gene expression analysis. Yet, to
                   date, few algorithms have been proposed for using
                   genome-wide deletion fitness data towards gene
                   regulatory network inference. Results: In this paper,
                   we describe a dynamical model and propose an
                   inference algorithm for using fitness data from
                   single-knockout libraries to identify the underlying
                   gene-regulatory networks. Unlike most prior methods,
                   the presented approach captures not only structural,
                   but also dynamical and non-linear nature of
                   biomolecular systems. The statespace model with
                   nonlinear basis is used for dynamically describing
                   the underlying biological regulatory networks.
                   Network structure is then elucidated by estimating
                   the unknown model parameters. The unscented Kalman
                   filter is employed to cope with the non-linearities
                   introduced in the model, which also enables the
                   algorithm to run in online mode for practical use.
                   Here, we demonstrate that the algorithm provides
                   satisfying results for both synthetic data as well as
                   empirical measurements of GAL network in yeast

                   handling linear regression problems where the number
                   of predictors far exceeds the number of cases. This
                   paper tests two exceptionally fast algorithms for
                   estimating regression coefficients with a lasso
                   penalty. The previously known ell2 algorithm is based
                   on cyclic coordinate descent. Our new ell1 algorithm
                   is based on greedy coordinate descent and Edgeworth's
                   algorithm for ordinary ell1 regression. Each
                   algorithm relies on a tuning constant that can be
                   chosen by cross-validation. In some regression
                   problems it is natural to group parameters and
                   penalize parameters group by group rather than
                   separately. If the group penalty is proportional to
                   the Euclidean norm of the parameters of the group,
                   then it is possible to majorize the norm and reduce
                   parameter estimation to ell2 regression with a lasso
                   penalty. Thus, the existing algorithm can be extended
                   to novel settings. Each of the algorithms discussed
                   is tested via either simulated or real data or both.
                   The Appendix proves that a greedy form of the ell2
                   algorithm converges to the minimum value of the
                   objective function.},

                   regulation events, various approaches have been
                   developed for deducing gene regulatory networks from
                   mRNA expression data.Results: We present a new score
                   for network inference, η2, that is derived from an
                   analysis of variance. Candidate transcription
                   factor:target gene (TF:TG) relationships are assumed
                   more likely if the expression of TF and TG are
                   mutually dependent in at least a subset of the
                   examined experiments. We evaluate this dependency by
                   η2, a non-parametric, non-linear correlation
                   coefficient. It is fast, easy to apply and does not
                   require the discretization of the input data. In the
                   recent DREAM5 blind assessment, the arguably most
                   comprehensive evaluation of inference methods, our
                   approach based on η2 was rated the best performer on
                   real expression compendia. It also performs better
                   than methods tested in other recently published
                   comparative assessments. About half of our predicted
                   novel predictions are true interactions as estimated
                   from qPCR experiments performed for
                   DREAM5.Conclusions: The score η2 has a number of
                   interesting features that enable the efficient
                   detection of gene regulatory interactions. For most
                   experimental setups, it is an interesting alternative

                   systems biology is the elucidation of the topology of
                   genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) using high
                   throughput genomic data, in particular microarray
                   gene expression data. The Dialogue for Reverse
                   Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) challenge
                   aims to evaluate the success of GRN inference
                   algorithms on benchmarks of simulated data. In this
                   article, we present GENIE3, a new algorithm for the
                   inference of GRNs that was best performer in the
                   DREAM4 \emph{In Silico Multifactorial} challenge.
                   GENIE3 decomposes the prediction of a regulatory
                   network between \emph{p} genes into \emph{p}
                   different regression problems. In each of the
                   regression problems, the expression pattern of one of
                   the genes (target gene) is predicted from the
                   expression patterns of all the other genes (input
                   genes), using tree-based ensemble methods Random
                   Forests or Extra-Trees. The importance of an input
                   gene in the prediction of the target gene expression
                   pattern is taken as an indication of a putative
                   regulatory link. Putative regulatory links are then
                   aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of
                   interactions from which the whole network is
                   reconstructed. In addition to performing well on the
                   DREAM4 \emph{In Silico Multifactorial} challenge
                   simulated data, we show that GENIE3 compares

  abstract =      {Reverse engineering bioinformatic procedures applied
                   to high-throughput experimental data have become
                   instrumental in generating new hypotheses about
                   molecular regulatory mechanisms. This has been
                   particularly the case for gene expression microarray
                   data, where a large number of statistical and
                   computational methodologies have been developed in
                   order to assist in building network models of
                   transcriptional regulation. A major challenge faced
                   by every different procedure is that the number of
                   available samples n for estimating the network model
                   is much smaller than the number of genes p forming
                   the system under study. This compromises many of the
                   assumptions on which the statistics of the methods
                   rely, often leading to unstable performance figures.
                   In this work, we apply a recently developed novel
                   methodology based in the so-called q-order limited
                   partial correlation graphs, qp-graphs, which is
                   specifically tailored towards molecular network
                   discovery from microarray expression data with p ? n.
                   Using experimental and functional annotation data
                   from Escherichia coli, here we show how qp-graphs
                   yield more stable performance figures than other
                   state-of-the-art methods when the ratio of genes to
                   experiments exceeds one order of magnitude. More
                   importantly, we also show that the better performance
                   of the qp-graph method on such a gene-to-sample ratio
                   has a decisive impact on the functional coherence of
                   the reverse-engineered transcriptional regulatory
                   modules and becomes crucial in such a challenging
                   situation in order to enable the discovery of a
                   network of reasonable confidence that includes a
                   substantial number of genes relevant to the essayed

  abstract =      {Motivation: Living cells are the product of gene
                   expression programs that involve the regulated
                   transcription of thousands of genes. The elucidation
                   of transcriptional regulatory networks is thus needed
                   to understand the cell's working mechanism, and can
                   for example, be useful for the discovery of novel
                   therapeutic targets. Although several methods have
                   been proposed to infer gene regulatory networks from
                   gene expression data, a recent comparison on a
                   large-scale benchmark experiment revealed that most
                   current methods only predict a limited number of
                   known regulations at a reasonable precision
                   level.Results: We propose SIRENE (Supervised
                   Inference of Regulatory Networks), a new method for
                   the inference of gene regulatory networks from a
                   compendium of expression data. The method decomposes
                   the problem of gene regulatory network inference into
                   a large number of local binary classification
                   problems, that focus on separating target genes from
                   non-targets for each transcription factor. SIRENE is
                   thus conceptually simple and computationally
                   efficient. We test it on a benchmark experiment aimed
                   at predicting regulations in Escherichia coli, and
                   show that it retrieves of the order of 6 times more
                   known regulations than other state-of-the-art
                   inference methods.Availability: All data and programs

                   from one method (e.g. microarray analysis, gene
                   ontology, phylogenic similarity) does not seem
                   feasible due to lack of sufficient information,
                   resulting in the construction of spurious or
                   incomplete TRNs. We develop a methodology, TRND, that
                   integrates a preliminary TRN, microarray data, gene
                   ontology and phylogenic similarity to accurately
                   discover TRNs and apply the method to E. coli K12.
                   The approach can easily be extended to include other
                   methodologies. Although gene ontology and phylogenic
                   similarity have been used in the context of gene-gene
                   networks, we show that more information can be
                   extracted when gene-gene scores are transformed to
                   gene-transcription factor (TF) scores using a
                   preliminary TRN. This seems to be preferable over the
                   construction of gene-gene interaction networks in
                   light of the observed fact that gene expression and
                   activity of a TF made of a component encoded by that
                   gene is often out of phase. TRND multi-method
                   integration is found to be facilitated by the use of
                   a Bayesian framework for each method derived from its
                   individual scoring measure and a training set of
                   gene/TF regulatory interactions. The TRNs we
                   construct are in better agreement with microarray
                   data. The number of gene/TF interactions we discover
                   is actually double that of existing networks.},

                   challenges toward their functional analysis. For this
                   reason gene network inference methods gained
                   considerable interest. However, our current
                   knowledge, especially about the influence of the
                   structure of a gene network on its inference, is
                   limited.RESULTS:In this paper we present a
                   comprehensive investigation of the structural
                   influence of gene networks on the inferential
                   characteristics of C3NET - a recently introduced gene
                   network inference algorithm. We employ local as well
                   as global performance metrics in combination with an
                   ensemble approach. The results from our numerical
                   study for various biological and synthetic network
                   structures and simulation conditions, also comparing
                   C3NET with other inference algorithms, lead a
                   multitude of theoretical and practical insights into
                   the working behavior of C3NET. In addition, in order
                   to facilitate the practical usage of C3NET we provide
                   an user-friendly R package, called c3net, and

                   availability of gene network inference algorithms

                   large-scale screening experiments that could be
                   equally beneficial for basic biological and

  abstract =      {An important problem in molecular biology is to build
                   a complete understanding of transcriptional
                   regulatory processes in the cell. We have developed a
                   flexible, probabilistic framework to predict TF
                   binding from multiple data sources that differs from
                   the standard hypothesis testing (scanning) methods in
                   several ways. Our probabilistic modeling framework
                   estimates the probability of binding and, thus,
                   naturally reflects our degree of belief in binding.
                   Probabilistic modeling also allows for easy and
                   systematic integration of our binding predictions
                   into other probabilistic modeling methods, such as
                   expression-based gene network inference. The method
                   answers the question of whether the whole analyzed
                   promoter has a binding site, but can also be extended
                   to estimate the binding probability at each
                   nucleotide position. Further, we introduce an
                   extension to model combinatorial regulation by
                   several TFs. Most importantly, the proposed methods
                   can make principled probabilistic inference from
                   multiple evidence sources, such as, multiple
                   statistical models (motifs) of the TFs, evolutionary
                   conservation, regulatory potential, CpG islands,
                   nucleosome positioning, DNase hypersensitive sites,
                   ChIP-chip binding segments and other (prior)
                   sequence-based biological knowledge. We developed
                   both a likelihood and a Bayesian method, where the
                   latter is implemented with a Markov chain Monte Carlo
                   algorithm. Results on a carefully constructed test
                   set from the mouse genome demonstrate that principled
                   data fusion can significantly improve the performance
                   of TF binding prediction methods. We also applied the
                   probabilistic modeling framework to all promoters in
                   the mouse genome and the results indicate a sparse
                   connectivity between transcriptional regulators and
                   their target promoters. To facilitate analysis of
                   other sequences and additional data, we have
                   developed an on-line web tool, ProbTF, which
                   implements our probabilistic TF binding prediction
                   method using multiple data sources. Test data set, a

  abstract =      {We present a novel method for deriving network models
                   from molecular profiles of perturbed cellular
                   systems. The network models aim to predict
                   quantitative outcomes of combinatorial perturbations,
                   such as drug pair treatments or multiple genetic
                   alterations. Mathematically, we represent the system
                   by a set of nodes, representing molecular
                   concentrations or cellular processes, a perturbation
                   vector and an interaction matrix. After perturbation,
                   the system evolves in time according to differential
                   equations with built-in nonlinearity, similar to
                   Hopfield networks, capable of representing epistasis
                   and saturation effects. For a particular set of
                   experiments, we derive the interaction matrix by
                   minimizing a composite error function, aiming at
                   accuracy of prediction and simplicity of network
                   structure. To evaluate the predictive potential of
                   the method, we performed 21 drug pair treatment
                   experiments in a human breast cancer cell line (MCF7)
                   with observation of phospho-proteins and cell cycle
                   markers. The best derived network model rediscovered
                   known interactions and contained interesting
                   predictions. Possible applications include the
                   discovery of regulatory interactions, the design of
                   targeted combination therapies and the engineering of

                   silico gene regulatory networks in the DREAM3
                   Challenges. Our task was to learn the networks from
                   two types of data, namely gene expression profiles in
                   deletion strains (the deletion data) and time series
                   trajectories of gene expression after some initial
                   perturbation (the perturbation data). In the course
                   of developing the prediction method, we observed that
                   the two types of data contained different and
                   complementary information about the underlying
                   network. In particular, deletion data allow for the
                   detection of direct regulatory activities with strong
                   responses upon the deletion of the regulator while
                   perturbation data provide richer information for the
                   identification of weaker and more complex types of
                   regulation. We applied different techniques to learn
                   the regulation from the two types of data. For
                   deletion data, we learned a noise model to
                   distinguish real signals from random fluctuations
                   using an iterative method. For perturbation data, we
                   used differential equations to model the change of
                   expression levels of a gene along the trajectories
                   due to the regulation of other genes. We tried
                   different models, and combined their predictions. The
                   final predictions were obtained by merging the
                   results from the two types of data. A comparison with
                   the actual regulatory networks suggests that our
                   approach is effective for networks with a range of
                   different sizes. The success of the approach
                   demonstrates the importance of integrating
                   heterogeneous data in network reconstruction.},

                   computational tools for identifying putative causal
                   interactions among variables from observational data.
                   Bayesian network inference algorithms hold particular
                   promise in that they can capture linear, non-linear,
                   combinatorial, stochastic and other types of
                   relationships among variables across multiple levels
                   of biological organization. However, challenges
                   remain when applying these algorithms to limited
                   quantities of experimental data collected from
                   biological systems. Here, we use a simulation
                   approach to make advances in our dynamic Bayesian
                   network (DBN) inference algorithm, especially in the
                   context of limited quantities of biological
                   data.Results: We test a range of scoring metrics and
                   search heuristics to find an effective algorithm
                   configuration for evaluating our methodological
                   advances. We also identify sampling intervals and
                   levels of data discretization that allow the best
                   recovery of the simulated networks. We develop a
                   novel influence score for DBNs that attempts to
                   estimate both the sign (activation or repression) and
                   relative magnitude of interactions among variables.
                   When faced with limited quantities of observational
                   data, combining our influence score with moderate
                   data interpolation reduces a significant portion of
                   false positive interactions in the recovered
                   networks. Together, our advances allow DBN inference
                   algorithms to be more effective in recovering
                   biological networks from experimentally collected
                   data.Availability: Source code and simulated data are

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND:DNA microarrays and other
                   genomics-inspired technologies provide large datasets
                   that often include hidden patterns of correlation
                   between genes reflecting the complex processes that
                   underlie cellular metabolism and physiology. The
                   challenge in analyzing large-scale expression data
                   has been to extract biologically meaningful
                   inferences regarding these processes - often
                   represented as networks - in an environment where the
                   datasets are often imperfect and biological noise can
                   obscure the actual signal. Although many techniques
                   have been developed in an attempt to address these
                   issues, to date their ability to extract meaningful
                   and predictive network relationships has been
                   limited. Here we describe a method that draws on
                   prior information about gene-gene interactions to
                   infer biologically relevant pathways from microarray
                   data. Our approach consists of using preliminary
                   networks derived from the literature and/or
                   protein-protein interaction data as seeds for a
                   Bayesian network analysis of microarray
                   results.RESULTS:Through a bootstrap analysis of gene
                   expression data derived from a number of leukemia
                   studies, we demonstrate that seeded Bayesian Networks
                   have the ability to identify high-confidence
                   gene-gene interactions which can then be validated by
                   comparison to other sources of pathway
                   data.CONCLUSION:The use of network seeds greatly
                   improves the ability of Bayesian Network analysis to
                   learn gene interaction networks from gene expression
                   data. We demonstrate that the use of seeds derived
                   from the biomedical literature or high-throughput
                   protein-protein interaction data, or the combination,
                   provides improvement over a standard Bayesian Network
                   analysis, allowing networks involving dynamic
                   processes to be deduced from the static snapshots of
                   biological systems that represent the most common
                   source of microarray data. Software implementing

                   fundamental to the operation of a cell. Revealing the
                   structure and dynamics of a gene regulatory network
                   (GRN) is of great interest and represents a
                   considerably challenging computational problem. The
                   GRN estimation problem is complicated by the fact
                   that the number of gene expression measurements is
                   typically extremely small when compared with the
                   dimension of the biological system. Further, because
                   the gene regulation process is intrinsically complex,
                   commonly used parametric models can provide too
                   simple description of the underlying phenomena and,
                   thus, can be unreliable. In this article, we propose
                   a novel methodology for the inference of GRNs from
                   time-series and steady-state gene expression
                   measurements. The presented framework is based on the
                   use of Bayesian analysis with ordinary differential
                   equations (ODEs) and non-parametric Gaussian process
                   modeling for the transcriptional-level
                   regulation.Results: The performance of the proposed
                   structure inference method is evaluated using a
                   recently published in vivo dataset. By comparing the
                   obtained results with those of existing ODE- and
                   Bayesian-based inference methods we demonstrate that
                   the proposed method provides more accurate network
                   structure learning. The predictive capabilities of
                   the method are examined by splitting the dataset into
                   a training set and a test set and by predicting the
                   test set based on the training set.Availability: A

  abstract =      {A central challenge in systems biology today is to
                   understand the network of interactions among
                   biomolecules and, especially, the organizing
                   principles underlying such networks. Recent analysis
                   of known networks has identified small motifs that
                   occur ubiquitously, suggesting that larger networks
                   might be constructed in the manner of electronic
                   circuits by assembling groups of these smaller
                   modules. Using a unique process-based approach to
                   analyzing such networks, we show for two cell-cycle
                   networks that each of these networks contains a giant
                   backbone motif spanning all the network nodes that
                   provides the main functional response. The backbone
                   is in fact the smallest network capable of providing
                   the desired functionality. Furthermore, the remaining
                   edges in the network form smaller motifs whose role
                   is to confer stability properties rather than provide
                   function. The process-based approach used in the
                   above analysis has additional benefits: It is
                   scalable, analytic (resulting in a single analyzable
                   expression that describes the behavior), and
                   computationally efficient (all possible minimal
                   networks for a biological process can be identified
                   and enumerated).},

  volume =        {6},
  year =          {2012},
  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: Modeling dynamic regulatory networks is a
                   major challenge since much of the protein-DNA
                   interaction data available is static. The Dynamic
                   Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) uses a Hidden Markov
                   Model-based approach to integrate this static
                   interaction data with time series gene expression
                   leading to models that can determine when
                   transcription factors (TFs) activate genes and what
                   genes they regulate. DREM has been used successfully
                   in diverse areas of biological research. However,
                   several issues were not addressed by the original
                   version. RESULTS: DREM 2.0 is a comprehensive
                   software for reconstructing dynamic regulatory
                   networks that supports interactive graphical or batch
                   mode. With version 2.0 a set of new features that are
                   unique in comparison with other softwares are
                   introduced. First, we provide static interaction data
                   for additional species. Second, DREM 2.0 now accepts
                   continuous binding values and we added a new method
                   to utilize TF expression levels when searching for
                   dynamic models. Third, we added support for
                   discriminative motif discovery, which is particularly
                   powerful for species with limited experimental
                   interaction data. Finally, we improved the
                   visualization to support the new features. Combined,
                   these changes improve the ability of DREM 2.0 to
                   accurately recover dynamic regulatory networks and
                   make it much easier to use it for analyzing such
                   networks in several species with varying degrees of
                   interaction information. CONCLUSIONS: DREM 2.0
                   provides a unique framework for constructing and
                   visualizing dynamic regulatory networks. DREM 2.0 can

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND:Gene regulatory network is an abstract
                   mapping of gene regulations in living cells that can
                   help to predict the system behavior of living
                   organisms. Such prediction capability can potentially
                   lead to the development of improved diagnostic tests
                   and therapeutics. DNA microarrays, which measure the
                   expression level of thousands of genes in parallel,
                   constitute the numeric seed for the inference of gene
                   regulatory networks. In this paper, we have proposed
                   a new approach for inferring gene regulatory networks
                   from time-series gene expression data using linear
                   time-variant model. Here, Self-Adaptive Differential
                   Evolution, a versatile and robust Evolutionary
                   Algorithm, is used as the learning
                   paradigm.RESULTS:To assess the potency of the
                   proposed work, a well known nonlinear synthetic
                   network has been used. The reconstruction method has
                   inferred this synthetic network topology and the
                   associated regulatory parameters with high accuracy
                   from both the noise-free and noisy time-series data.
                   For validation purposes, the proposed approach is
                   also applied to the simulated expression dataset of
                   cAMP oscillations in Dictyostelium discoideum and has
                   proved it's strength in finding the correct
                   regulations. The strength of this work has also been
                   verified by analyzing the real expression dataset of
                   SOS DNA repair system in Escherichia coli and it has
                   succeeded in finding more correct and reasonable
                   regulations as compared to various existing
                   works.CONCLUSION:By the proposed approach, the gene
                   interaction networks have been inferred in an
                   efficient manner from both the synthetic, simulated
                   cAMP oscillation expression data and real expression
                   data. The computational time of this approach is also
                   considerably smaller, which makes it to be more
                   suitable for larger network reconstruction. Thus the
                   proposed approach can serve as an initiate for the
                   future researches regarding the associated area.},

                   provided a particularly realistic and challenging
                   setting for network reverse engineering methods. The
                   <italic>in silico</italic> part of DREAM4 solicited
                   the inference of cycle-rich gene regulatory networks
                   from heterogeneous, noisy expression data including
                   time courses as well as knockout, knockdown and
                   multifactorial perturbations. Methodology and
                   Principal Findings: We inferred and parametrized
                   simulation models based on Petri Nets with Fuzzy
                   Logic (PNFL). This completely automated approach
                   correctly reconstructed networks with cycles as well
                   as oscillating network motifs. PNFL was evaluated as
                   the best performer on DREAM4 <italic>in
                   silico</italic> networks of size 10 with an area
                   under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) of 81\%.
                   Besides topology, we inferred a range of additional
                   mechanistic details with good reliability, e.g.
                   distinguishing activation from inhibition as well as
                   dependent from independent regulation. Our models
                   also performed well on new experimental conditions
                   such as double knockout mutations that were not
                   included in the provided datasets. Conclusions: The
                   inference of biological networks substantially
                   benefits from methods that are expressive enough to
                   deal with diverse datasets in a unified way. At the
                   same time, overly complex approaches could generate
                   multiple different models that explain the data
                   equally well. PNFL appears to strike the balance
                   between expressive power and complexity. This also
                   applies to the intuitive representation of PNFL
                   models combining a straightforward graphical notation
                   with colloquial fuzzy parameters.},

                   transcriptomic datasets collected under multiple
                   experimental conditions has proven to be a powerful
                   approach for disentangling complex biological
                   processes, allowing for the reverse engineering of
                   gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Most methods for
                   reverse engineering GRNs from multiple datasets
                   assume that each of the time series were generated
                   from networks with identical topology. In this study,
                   we outline a hierarchical, non-parametric Bayesian
                   approach for reverse engineering GRNs using multiple
                   time series that can be applied in a number of novel
                   situations including: (i) where different, but
                   overlapping sets of transcription factors are
                   expected to bind in the different experimental
                   conditions; that is, where switching events could
                   potentially arise under the different treatments and
                   (ii) for inference in evolutionary related species in
                   which orthologous GRNs exist. More generally, the
                   method can be used to identify context-specific
                   regulation by leveraging time series gene expression
                   data alongside methods that can identify putative
                   lists of transcription factors or transcription
                   factor targets.Results: The hierarchical inference
                   outperforms related (but non-hierarchical) approaches
                   when the networks used to generate the data were
                   identical, and performs comparably even when the
                   networks used to generate data were independent. The
                   method was subsequently used alongside yeast one
                   hybrid and microarray time series data to infer
                   potential transcriptional switches in Arabidopsis
                   thaliana response to stress. The results confirm
                   previous biological studies and allow for additional
                   insights into gene regulation under various abiotic
                   stresses.Availability: The methods outlined in this

  abstract =      {Network inference deals with the reconstruction of
                   biological networks from experimental data. A variety
                   of different reverse engineering techniques are
                   available; they differ in the underlying assumptions
                   and mathematical models used. One common problem for
                   all approaches stems from the complexity of the task,
                   due to the combinatorial explosion of different
                   network topologies for increasing network size. To
                   handle this problem, constraints are frequently used,
                   for example on the node degree, number of edges, or
                   constraints on regulation functions between network
                   components. We propose to exploit topological
                   considerations in the inference of gene regulatory
                   networks. Such systems are often controlled by a
                   small number of hub genes,while most other genes have
                   only limited influence on the network's dynamic. We
                   model gene regulation using a Bayesian network with
                   discrete, Boolean nodes. A hierarchical prior is
                   employed to identify hub genes. The first layer of
                   the prior is used to regularize weights on edges
                   emanating from one specific node. A second prior on
                   hyperparameters controls the magnitude of the former
                   regularization for different nodes. The net effect is
                   that central nodes tend to form in reconstructed
                   networks. Network reconstruction is then performed by
                   maximization of or sampling from the posterior
                   distribution. We evaluate our approach on simulated
                   and real experimental data, indicating that we can
                   reconstruct main regulatory interactions from the
                   data. We furthermore compare our approach to other
                   state-of-the art methods, showing superior
                   performance in identifying hubs. Using a large
                   publicly available dataset of over 800 cell cycle
                   regulated genes, we are able to identify several main
                   hub genes. Our method may thus provide a valuable
                   tool to identify interesting candidate genes for
                   further study. Furthermore, the approach presented
                   may stimulate further developments in regularization
                   methods for network reconstruction from data.},

                   for generating Boolean networks whose state
                   transitions realize a set of given biological
                   pathways or minor variations thereof. This ill-posed
                   inverse problem, which is of crucial importance
                   across practically all areas of biology, is solved by
                   using Karnaugh maps which are classical tools for
                   digital system design. It is shown that the
                   incorporation of prior knowledge, presented in the
                   form of biological pathways, can bring about a
                   dramatic reduction in the cardinality of the network
                   search space. Constraining the connectivity of the
                   network, the number and relative importance of the
                   attractors, and concordance with observed time-course
                   data are additional factors that can be used to
                   further reduce the cardinality of the search space.
                   The networks produced by the approaches developed
                   here should facilitate the understanding of
                   multivariate biological phenomena and the subsequent
                   design of intervention approaches that are more
                   likely to be successful in practice. As an example,
                   the results of this paper are applied to the widely
                   studied p53 pathway and it is shown that the

  abstract =      {For the inference of S-system models of genetic
                   networks, this study proposes a new method, i.e., a
                   two-phase estimation method. The two-phase estimation
                   method is an extension of the decoupling approach
                   proposed by Voit and Almeida. The decoupling approach
                   defines the estimation of S-system parameters as a
                   problem of solving sets of non-linear algebraic
                   equations. Our method first transforms each set of
                   non-linear algebraic equations, that is defined by
                   the decoupling approach, into a set of linear ones.
                   The transformation of the equations is easily
                   accomplished by solving a linear programming problem.
                   The proposed method then estimates S-system
                   parameters by solving the transformed linear
                   equations. As the proposed two-phase estimation
                   method infers an S-system model only by solving
                   linear programming problems and sets of linear
                   algebraic equations, it always provides us with a
                   unique solution. Moreover, its computational cost is
                   very low. Finally, we confirm the effectiveness of
                   the proposed method through numerical experiments.},

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: Understanding gene interactions in
                   complex living systems can be seen as the ultimate
                   goal of the systems biology revolution. Hence, to
                   elucidate disease ontology fully and to reduce the
                   cost of drug development, gene regulatory networks
                   (GRNs) have to be constructed. During the last
                   decade, many GRN inference algorithms based on
                   genome-wide data have been developed to unravel the
                   complexity of gene regulation. Time series
                   transcriptomic data measured by genome-wide DNA
                   microarrays are traditionally used for GRN modelling.
                   One of the major problems with microarrays is that a
                   dataset consists of relatively few time points with
                   respect to the large number of genes. Dimensionality
                   is one of the interesting problems in GRN modelling.
                   RESULTS: In this paper, we develop a biclustering
                   function enrichment analysis toolbox (BicAT-plus) to
                   study the effect of biclustering in reducing data
                   dimensions. The network generated from our system was
                   validated via available interaction databases and was
                   compared with previous methods. The results revealed
                   the performance of our proposed method. CONCLUSIONS:
                   Because of the sparse nature of GRNs, the results of
                   biclustering techniques differ significantly from
                   those of previous methods.},

                   the systems biology community. In this article, a new
                   hybrid algorithm integrating ordinary differential
                   equation models with dynamic Bayesian network
                   analysis, called Differential Equation-based Local
                   Dynamic Bayesian Network (DELDBN), was proposed and
                   implemented for gene regulatory network
                   inference.Results: The performance of DELDBN was
                   benchmarked with an in vivo dataset from yeast.
                   DELDBN significantly improved the accuracy and
                   sensitivity of network inference compared with other
                   approaches. The local causal discovery algorithm
                   implemented in DELDBN also reduced the complexity of
                   the network inference algorithm and improved its
                   scalability to infer larger networks. We have
                   demonstrated the applicability of the approach to a
                   network containing thousands of genes with a dataset
                   from human HeLa cell time series experiments. The
                   local network around BRCA1 was particularly
                   investigated and validated with independent published
                   studies. BRAC1 network was significantly enriched
                   with the known BRCA1-relevant interactions,
                   indicating that DELDBN can effectively infer large

  abstract =      {MOTIVATION: Reconstruction of gene regulatory
                   networks (GRNs) is of utmost interest to biologists
                   and is vital for understanding the complex regulatory
                   mechanisms within the cell. Despite various methods
                   developed for reconstruction of GRNs from gene
                   expression profiles, they are notorious for high
                   false positive rate due to the noise inherited in the
                   data, especially for the dataset with a large number
                   of genes but a small number of samples. RESULTS: In
                   this work, we present a novel method, namely NARROMI,
                   to improve the accuracy of GRN inference by combining
                   ordinary differential equation based recursive
                   optimization (RO) and information theory based mutual
                   information (MI). In the proposed algorithm, the
                   noisy regulations with low pairwise correlations are
                   first removed by utilizing MI, and the redundant
                   regulations from indirect regulators are further
                   excluded by RO to improve the accuracy of inferred
                   GRNs. In particular, the RO step can help to
                   determine regulatory directions without prior
                   knowledge of regulators. The results on benchmark
                   datasets from DREAM challenge and experimentally
                   determined GRN of Escherichia coli show that NARROMI
                   significantly outperforms other popular methods in
                   terms of false positive rates and accuracy.

                   estimation (model calibration) and optimal
                   experimental design are particularly challenging. The

                   topology, interaction among regulators of
                   transcription, and expression dynamics. The simulator
                   generates network topology according to the current
                   knowledge of biological network organization,
                   including scale-free distribution of the connectivity
                   and clustering coefficient independent of the number
                   of nodes in the network. It uses fuzzy logic to
                   represent interactions among the regulators of each
                   gene, integrated with differential equations to
                   generate continuous data, comparable to real data for
                   variety and dynamic complexity. Finally, the
                   simulator accounts for saturation in the response to
                   regulation and transcription activation thresholds
                   and shows robustness to perturbations. It therefore
                   provides a reliable and versatile test bed for
                   reverse engineering algorithms applied to microarray
                   data. Since the simulator describes regulatory
                   interactions and expression dynamics as two distinct,
                   although interconnected aspects of regulation, it can
                   also be used to test reverse engineering approaches
                   that use both microarray and protein-protein
                   interaction data in the process of learning. A first

                   widely used general purpose mathematical software
                   MATLAB. The toolbox offers systems biologists an open
                   and extensible environment, in which to explore
                   ideas, prototype and share new algorithms, and build
                   applications for the analysis and simulation of
                   biological and biochemical systems. Additionally it
                   is well suited for educational purposes. The toolbox
                   supports the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)
                   by providing an interface for import and export of
                   SBML models. In this way the toolbox connects nicely
                   to other SBML-enabled modelling packages. Models are
                   represented in an internal model format and can be
                   described either by entering ordinary differential
                   equations or, more intuitively, by entering
                   biochemical reaction equations. The toolbox contains
                   a large number of analysis methods, such as
                   deterministic and stochastic simulation, parameter
                   estimation, network identification, parameter
                   sensitivity analysis and bifurcation
                   analysis.Availability: The Systems Biology Toolbox
                   for MATLAB is open source and freely available from

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND:In the last decade, a great number of
                   methods for reconstructing gene regulatory networks
                   from expression data have been proposed. However,
                   very few tools and datasets allow to evaluate
                   accurately and reproducibly those methods. Hence, we
                   propose here a new tool, able to perform a
                   systematic, yet fully reproducible, evaluation of
                   transcriptional network inference methods.RESULTS:Our
                   open-source and freely available Bioconductor package

                   robustness of network inference algorithms against
                   different simulators, topologies, sample sizes and
                   noise intensities.CONCLUSIONS:The benchmarking
                   framework that uses various datasets highlights the
                   specialization of some methods toward network types
                   and data. As a result, it is possible to identify the
                   techniques that have broad overall performances.},

                   understanding of cellular functions is to correctly
                   uncover and annotate all functional interactions
                   among proteins in the cell. Toward this goal,
                   remarkable progress has been made in recent years,
                   both in terms of experimental measurements and
                   computational prediction techniques. However, public
                   efforts to collect and present protein interaction
                   information have struggled to keep up with the pace
                   of interaction discovery, partly because
                   protein-protein interaction information can be
                   error-prone and require considerable effort to
                   annotate. Here, we present an update on the online
                   database resource Search Tool for the Retrieval of
                   Interacting Genes (STRING); it provides uniquely
                   comprehensive coverage and ease of access to both
                   experimental as well as predicted interaction
                   information. Interactions in STRING are provided with
                   a confidence score, and accessory information such as
                   protein domains and 3D structures is made available,
                   all within a stable and consistent identifier space.
                   New features in STRING include an interactive network
                   viewer that can cluster networks on demand, updated
                   on-screen previews of structural information
                   including homology models, extensive data updates and
                   strongly improved connectivity and integration with
                   third-party resources. Version 9.0 of STRING covers
                   more than 1100 completely sequenced organisms; the
                   resource can be reached at http://string-db.org.},

                   or functional associations, between genes and gene
                   products. Identifying these functional couplings is
                   an important step in the understanding of higher
                   level mechanisms performed by complex cellular
                   processes. FunCoup distinguishes between four classes
                   of couplings: participation in the same signaling
                   cascade, participation in the same metabolic process,
                   co-membership in a protein complex and physical

                   novel method to incorporate phylogenetic profile

                   new data have been added in FunCoup 3.0. Furthermore,
